A blockchain ased system to unify identification data from all countries into a borderless global  passport. This is the top hack idea proposed and we would like to have a crack at it with our own approach. Our identity system will also have sub-modules that will allow this decentralized ledger to operate insurance, land, relationships, financial matters seamlessly.

Web and mobile app (to be built)

Proposed dependencies

PHP 5 core lib
Lavarel framework 
Google php lib
Amazon AWS php lib
Php word and excel file readers

Compiled Modules Will not be published here

Usage:

1.Sends national identity number to generate blockchain public key

2.Send public key to smart contract deployed on Ehtereum blockchain at: TBD to generate global identity

Use the identity key for borderless applications that conform to this smart contract
